HELLO GUYS!!
You are going to use modules in the following exercises, specifically the Numpy module.
So if your IDE does not have this extension you can use this online platform ( replit.com ), navigate to where the python language is and it will automatically add in a main.py file and you'll be ready to use this module.

GOOD LUCK!!
